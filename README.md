## **Tech Stack**

### Frontend

* React + Vite
* React Router v6
* Tailwind CSS
* Context API for state management

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Passport.js with Google OAuth 2.0

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (v14 or higher)
* MongoDB
* npm or yarn

You'll also need:

* A Google Cloud Console account for OAuth credentials
* MongoDB Atlas account (for production database)

## **Getting Started**

### 1. Clone the repository

`https://github.com/zaryabnaqvi/studyspace-FE`

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```js
//Frontend
cd edu/
npm install

//Backend
cd backend/
npm install
```

### 3. Create your environment variables

Create a .env file in the config folder in the backend directory:

```js
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```js
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. Start the server

For development purposes, run the API with the following (make sure you're in backend/):

`node server.js --watch`

The API should now be available at `http://localhost:5000/api/resources`.

### 5. Run the application

In another terminal window, start the application locally (make sure you're in edu/):

`npm run dev`

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:4444`.

## **How It Works**

### **For Educators:**

Educators can add their educational materials, guides, and courses by clicking "Add Resources". Each resource can include details like title, description, type (course, tutorial, etc.), and more.

### **For Learners:**

Learners can browse through a list of curated resources to find the perfect content based on their skill level and interests.

### **CRUD Operations:**

* **Add a Resource:** Create new educational tools or content for others to access.
* **Edit a Resource:** Modify existing resources to ensure they are up-to-date.
* **Delete a Resource:** Remove outdated or irrelevant resources.

### **Routing with React Router:**

This app uses **React Router** to handle navigation between different pages, such as the home page, the "Add Resource" page, and individual resource detail pages.

### **State Management with React `useState`:**

State is managed using React's `useState` hook to dynamically render data (e.g., resources) and handle updates across the app.

### **Styling with Tailwind CSS:**

The app uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, providing a fast and efficient way to design responsive, customisable user interfaces.

## Future Improvements

* [X] User profiles with saved resources
* [ ] Advanced search and filtering
* [ ] Resource sharing functionality
* [ ] Resource recommendations
* [ ] List creation (like GitHub with stars, create a list and add resources to a list)
* [ ] Private or public resources
* [ ] Minor UI changes
