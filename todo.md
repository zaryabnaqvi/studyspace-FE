* [X] Hosting backend separately or no ????? probably. YES
* [X] Change servers, render too slow on free tier
* [X] Fix uri mismatch even though they are matched ??

### FUTURE UPDATES:

People can create lists (like GitHub w/ stars, create a list and add resources to a list)

make lists shareable

change categories to tags so you can select (on filter) multiple, and resources can have multiple categories

Resources can be public or private

* [X] fix filter to work with pagination

Profiles: click icon to view someone's public profile (will only show public resources and lists)

Add more resource types: Article,

Implement character limits on form for each category.

Add more categories: Documentation

Redirect loading back to homepage (rn its success = true), using AuthContext

read for duplicates, resource already exists something like that

Button to Add and Edit resource, rounded. MyResourcesPage -> Add First Resource button: make consistent with all the rest.

Local passport integration

Remove all console logs.

When deleting a resource, instead of taking you back to '/resources', it should take you back to where you were last browsing (eg. page 2, in the middle of the page is where you should be redirected to)

After adding a resource, when it redirects you to /resources, the filters should stay on until you reset them.

Add tags: free, or paid. tiers: `$, $$, $$$`

### ERRORS OR FUTURE FIXES

* [ ] aos interfering with hover on resourcelisting
* [ ] Protect edit resource in the backend (having trouble)
* [X] might be more useful to see the user who uploaded it, and maybe have the creator of the resource showing somewhere smaller
